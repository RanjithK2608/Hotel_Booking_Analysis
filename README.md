#PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.


#CONCLUSION:

1) Prices of resort hotel are much higher. It seems that that is definitely the case since resort hotels specialise in that.
2) Prices of city hotel do not fluctuate that much.
3) Majority of the hotels booked are city hotel. Definitely need to spend the most targeting fund on those hotel.
4) We also realise that the high rate of cancellations can be due high no deposit policies.
5) We should also target months between May to Aug. Those are peak months due to the summer period.
6) Majority of the guests are from Western Europe. We should spend a significant amount of our budget on those area.
7) Given that we do not have repeated guests, we should target our advertisement on guests to increase returning guests
8) After analyzing the meal data, its found that 77.3% of customers prefers BB(Bread & Breakfast).
9) Online Travel agencies provides high amount of leads and customers following Offline TA, Groups, Direct, etc., So, we an conclude that we need to focus our marketing area on online TA since majority of the visitors tend to reach out to them.
10) Most of the hotels have 0 to 1 car parking space.
